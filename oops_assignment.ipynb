    "\n",
    "# Encapsulation: |This involves bundling data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit, typically a class.\n",
    "#      It helps in hiding the internal state of the object from the outside world and only exposing necessary functionalities.\n",
    "#      Encapsulation is implemented using access modifiers like private, protected, and public.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# Abstraction: Abstraction is the concept of hiding the complex implementation details and showing only the necessary features of an object.\n",
    "#  It allows a programmer to focus on interactions at a high level without worrying about the intricate workings.\n",
    "#  Abstraction is achieved through abstract classes and interfaces.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# Inheritance: Inheritance allows a new class to inherit the properties and behaviors (methods) of an existing class.\n",
    "#  The new class, known as the subclass or derived class, can reuse, extend, or modify the functionalities of the parent class.\n",
    "#  This promotes code reusability and establishes a hierarchical relationship between classes.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# Polymorphism: Polymorphism enables objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass.\n",
    "#  The most common types are method overriding (runtime polymorphism) and method overloading (compile-time polymorphism).\n",
    "#  This allows for methods to be used interchangeably and promotes flexibility and integration in code.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# Composition: Composition involves building complex objects by combining simpler ones.\n",
    "#  Instead of inheriting from a base class, a class can contain objects of other classes, using their functionalities to achieve a more complex behavior.\n",
    "#  This is often preferred over inheritance for creating more modular and flexible systems.\n"
